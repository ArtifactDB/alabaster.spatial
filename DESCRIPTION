Package: alabaster.spatial
Title: Save and Load Spatial 'Omics Data to/from File
Description: 
    Save SpatialExperiment objects and their images into file artifacts, and load them back into memory.
    This is a more portable alternative to serialization of such objects into RDS files.
    Each artifact is associated with metadata for further interpretation;
    downstream applications can enrich this metadata with context-specific properties.
